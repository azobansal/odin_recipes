        <h3>About the recipe</h3>
        <p>
            It seems strange that I've managed to write seven books without one plain chocolate chip cookie 
            (by which I mean a plain cookie with chocolate chips in it). It's true that the Totally Chocolate 
            Chocolate Chip Cookie made an appearance once, and it's only buoyed up by its success that I've felt 
            confident enough to create this one. For here's the thing: you'd think a plain cookie with a few chocolate 
            chips folded into the mixture would be a simple matter. It's not. It's never difficult to make, just difficult 
            to get right. I may be picky, but to my mind, or my mouth, a cookie that's too crisp feels dry and disappointing 
            and a cookie that's too chewy tastes like dough. I want a bit of tender, fudgy chewiness but an edge of crisp bite, too.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p><strong>Makes: approx. 14 cookies</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>150g soft unsalted butter</li>
            <li>125g soft light brown sugar</li>
            <li>100g caster sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 egg (fridge-cold)</li>
            <li>1 yolk (fridge-cold)</li>
            <li>300g plain flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 x 326g packet milk chocolate morsels or chips</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 170°C/150°C Fan/325°F. Line a baking sheet with baking parchment.
            </li>
            <li>
                Melt the butter and let it cool a bit. Put the brown and white sugars into a bowl, 
                pour the slightly cooled, melted butter over them and beat together.
            </li>
            <li>
                Beat in the vanilla, the cold egg and cold egg yolk until your mixture is light and creamy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Slowly mix in the flour and bicarb until just blended, then fold in the chocolate chips.
            </li>
            <li>
                Scoop the cookie dough into an American quarter-cup measure or a 60ml/quarter cup round icecream 
                scoop and drop onto the prepared baking sheet, plopping the cookies down about 8cm/3 inches apart. 
                You will need to make these in 2 batches, keeping the bowl of cookie dough in the fridge between batches.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake for 15-17 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the edges are lightly toasted. Cool on the baking 
                sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to wire racks.
            </li>
        </ol>
