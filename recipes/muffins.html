        <h3>About the recipe</h3>
        <p>
            I think of muffins as a treaty weekend breakfast, but these look so darkly elegant, especially in 
            their matching dark-brown, tulip-skirted party frocks, that they positively beg to be brought out with 
            coffee after dinner. Certainly, while most muffins are at their best pretty well straight out of the oven, 
            the bananas in the mixture make sure these beauties keep their moist, eat-me texture long after those less 
            favoured have staled and lost their allure.

        <p><strong>Makes: 12 muffins</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>3 medium-450g<strong>(total weight with skin on)</strong>-very ripe or overipe bananas</li>
            <!--abbr tag to add abbreviations--> 
            <li>125<abbr title="millilitres">ml</abbr> vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>100g soft light brown sugar</li>
            <li>225g plain flour</li>
            <li>3 tablespoon best quality cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C Fan/400°F/gas mark 6 and line a 12-bun muffin tin with papers. 
                Don't worry about getting special papers: regular muffin cases will do the job.
            </li>
            <li>
                Peel and mash the bananas by hand or with a freestanding mixer. Still beating and mashing, add the oil 
                followed by the eggs and sugar.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix the flour, cocoa powder and bicarb together and add this mixture, beating gently, to the banana mixture, 
                then spoon it into the prepared papers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, by which time the muffins should be dark, rounded and peeking proudly out of their cases. 
                Allow to cool slightly in their tin before removing to a wire rack.
            </li>
        </ol>
